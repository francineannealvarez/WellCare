# **WellCare: Hospital Booking System 🏥**

## **I. Project Overview 🌟**

**WellCare: Hospital Booking System** is a Java-based application designed to simplify the management of patient appointments, doctor schedules, and medical histories within a hospital setting. The system aims to streamline interactions between patients, doctors, and administrators, making healthcare management more efficient and accessible.

Through the application, patients can book appointments, view medical histories, and explore health tips, while doctors manage their schedules and provide diagnoses. The system also includes a health tips section that is not limited to patients but is available to all users for improving their health and lifestyle.

Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, **WellCare** offers an intuitive interface and leverages the power of abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to deliver a robust, maintainable, and scalable application.
